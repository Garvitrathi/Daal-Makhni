Notes:
firstly, slow cook the dal to get rich flavour.
also adding rajma is optional, however, it adds more flavour to dal makhani.
if you are not diet conscious, increase the amount of ghee.
also add dry fenugreek leaves / kasuri methi for rich flavour.
finally, dal makhani recipe served in restaurants are usually more creamy and will be difficult to eat more. i have kept it limited to enjoy the real flavours.
